nonstandards
============

A model for generating jazz standards

For now, everything is contained in an ipython notebook.

You'll need the following dependencies:

 - sklearn (sklearn.hmm)
 - cPickle, glob, re

To train the model, you'll need the humdrum files located at http://musiccog.ohio-state.edu/home/index.php/iRb_Jazz_Corpus

After that, the notebook script should be self-explanatory.
